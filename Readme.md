## POS backend


```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World')
})

app.listen(3000)
```

## Installation

```console
$ yarn 
```

## Quick Start

  The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable [`express(1)`](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) to generate an application as shown below:

  Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

```console
$ npm install -g express-generator@4
```

  Create the app:

```console
$ express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

  Install dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

  Start the server:

```console
$ npm start
```

  View the website at: http://localhost:3000


### Running Tests

To run the test suite, first install the dependencies, then run `npm test`:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
